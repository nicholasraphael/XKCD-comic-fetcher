# Element Classes

As you build the project, pay close attention to our CSS class name requirements. This will help ensure your app passes our automated tests. It will also allow us to see how well you follow instructions.

## Home Page

There should be a navigation with 2 links, a "Latest" and a "Search" button/link.

#### Classes

- The "Latest" link should have a class of `latest` on the clickable button.
- The "Search" link should have a class of `search` on the clickable button.
- Lastly, the image that will be displayed should have a class of `latestImage` on it.

## Search Page

The navigation will be identical to that on the "Home Page".

#### Classes

- The search input should have a class of `searchInput` on the input itself.
- The search button should have a class of `searchSubmit` on the input itself.
- Lastly, the image that will be displayed should have a class of `searchImage` on it.

## Images

All images should have both `title` and `alt` text on them.

- The `alt` text should be pulled from the "title" field in the API response.
- The `title` text should be pulled from the "alt" field in the API response.
